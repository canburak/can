Hi, I am Can;

I was born in Istanbul, lived couple of years in Singapore, currently residing in New York City. I like swimming, scuba diving, developing software and of course seeing new places and observing different cultures. I am earning my life as an [SRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_reliability_engineering) [at LinkedIn](https://engineering.linkedin.com/new-york-engineering#site-reliability).

If you are interested in my professional experience, visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/canburakcilingir/).  I also have a boutique [twitter profile](https://twitter.com/canburak/), which is almost all the time in Turkish. Finally, [a blog](https://medium.com/@canburak), for the sake of having it; nothing much recent. ([My instagram profile](https://www.instagram.com/canbc/) is updated more frequently than my blog though!)
