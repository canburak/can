# Publications

I've delivered couple of talks and written about some topics, years ago. I am no longer doing that, at least not publicly. I keep these for archival purposes. Even the links are broken!

[Concepts of Operating a Web Site][concepts] was a slideshow I used while delivering a [COMP 461][] lecture.

I've editored [proceedings][] of [tOSSad Workshop][toSSad] on "Governmental, Educational, Usability, and Legal Issues towards Open Source Software Adoption in an enlarged Europe" which was an EU project funded under FP6 IST, with Bülent Özel and Kaan Erkan.

[Türkiye'deki Üniversiteleri İnternet'te Daha Görünür Kılan Faktörler][internette-gorunur-kilan] was a paper authored with Harald Schmidbauer and Vehbi Sinan Tunalıoğlu which was presented in [Türkiye'de İnternet][inettr]
 conference. (Title in English: The factors that make the universities in Turkey more visible on the Internet)

[Sanal Dünyada Varolmak: Üniversite ve Internet][sanal-dunyada-varolmak] was a paper authored with Harald Schmidbauer, Mehmet Gençer and Vehbi Sinan Tunalıoğlu, presented in [Akademik Bilişim][akademik-bilisim] conference. (Title in English: Existence in the Virtual World: University and Internet)

[Güvenlik Duvarı Kurallarına Birim Test Yöntemi Uygulanması][guvenlik-duvari] was a paper authored with Remzi Emre Başar, presented in [Akademik Bilişim][akademik-bilisim] conference. (Title in English: Applying Unit Testing Methodology on Firewall Rules)

[Cacti: Ağınızın Yönetim Kokpiti][cacti] (Cacti: Control Panel on Your Network)

[IP Muhasebesi: IPTables ve RRDTool'a Uygulamalı Giriş][ip-muhasebesi] (IP Accounting: Hands on Introduction to IPTables and RRDTool)

[David's Advanced Revision System][darcs]
